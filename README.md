# Spirit of Design
The S.o.D of this project is to make something fun, and not necessarily useful. The reason it has a thumb trigger instead of a traditional finger trigger is because it looks more silly and more like a toy. It is requested but not required any spin offs keep in line of make a fun child's toy instead of a super serious crossbow.

# TODO
* Issue printing 0.18mm gcode. Looking into reasons
* Work on designs for printing max number of rails per print bed
* Work on design of a unit without need to cut the rubberband
